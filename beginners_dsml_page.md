**Model**: Supervised - Classification

**Explanation**: In this project, I will create a model that can classify each data into their class and calculate the accuracy from the model. The algorithm that I used are: Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes.

[2. Loan Prediction Dataset Project](https://github.com/richardraphitaompusunggu/datascience_and_machinelearning/blob/master/Loan%20Prediction%20Dataset/Loan%20Prediction%20Problem.ipynb)
