# Portfolio

This is my machine learning portofolio that I have done using data that can be found from Kaggle and other websites. This portofolio include many problems from different industry and use different algorithm approach to solve the problems. I devide the portofolio into 3 parts: **Beginners, Intermediate, Advanced** machine learning project.
